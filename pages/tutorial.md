# How to Search for Items in Digital Collections

{% include feature/nav-menu.html sections="Home Page;Search Page" %}

## Home Page

If you donâ€™t have a specific search term you want to look for you can begin on the [home page](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, you can begin by searching all of our collections by topic or media type by selecting those buttons.

- To search our collections by name or by when the collection was created, select the `Browse All Collections` button.

Alternately, select the `Browse` dropdown menu on the main page to:

- Search collections by their most frequent subjects, location names and geographic coordinates.
- Use the timeline feature to understand the date ranges of each collection.
- Or view the collections as `Data` if you want a broad overview of the material without any contextual images.

- To search by keyword across all collections, enter in the main search bar and select `Search`.

## Search Page

This will bring you to the [search page](https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/search?){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where you can sort results by relevance, alphabetically by title, date and genre (image, pdf, newspaper, map, etc.).

- You can also adjust the number of items per page and whether they display in list or tile format.

- Expanding the `Advanced Options` panel, you can choose which metadata fields you would like to search your keyword for, such as title, location and creator.
